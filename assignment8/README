==========================================

To build, run

% make all
in this directory (top-level).

==========================================

To test, cd to either rps/ or ttt/ and run

% make player1

to play as player 1, and then

% make player2

to play as player 2. Or you can run either binary with the -a switch to set as player A (none for player b), with the following syntax:

ttt [-a] [local host] [remote host]

An example run:

ttt -a localhost:1234 localhost:1235

(on a different tty)

ttt localhost:1235 localhost:1234

The "q" key will exit either game at any time.
