To build, run
% make all
in this directory (top-level).

To test, cd to either rps/ or ttt/ and run
% make test
That will start the program. The rock paper scissors game works best with a second terminal, but for simplicity 'make test' runs it all on one; it will therefore prompt for both A and B's moves at once. Type the first move, hit enter, then type the second move and hit enter.

The "q" key will exit either game at any time.
