<p>
This program does operations on a list of unrealistic &#34;wagons&#34; on a prairie. It is initialized with two wagons, a head and a tail. The size of the prairie defaults to 30x30 and can be set via command line arguments as well.
</p>
<p>
Once running, keystrokes from the user move and modify the wagon train. The keys u, d, l, and r move the head, while U, D, L, and R move the tail. When the head moves, the next wagon in the train takes the head&#39;s old position and all the other wagons move to the previous position of their leader. Moving the tail works similarly.
</p>
<p>
Pressing the &#34;a&#34; key creates a new wagon in the upper left corner of the prairie, which becomes the new head. Pressing &#34;A&#34; makes a new wagon in the lower right corner to act as the new tail.
</p>
<p>
The &#34;q&#34; key quits the program.
