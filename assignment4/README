=============

Compilation:

* cd dag && make
* cd mk && make
* mk/bin/mk -f [some makefile]
* cd mk && make test to run tests

Make targets
============

all: Build everything
clean: clean up binaries and object files
doc: Start the http documentation server. Documentation is at http://localhost:6060/pkg/dagmake
test: Run some tests.

The binary will be saved as "bin/mk". Running it with no arguments loads a file called "mkfile" in the current directory and executes the first target. Giving it the "-f filename" option allows specification of the file name. Any other arguments are taken to be targets which should be executed.
